**Note**: This software is actively being developed and some functionality may change.

To start a new project using the reprint-starter, PHP/Composer must be installed. Run the following composer command to create a new project:

`composer create-project --stability=dev greymass/reprint-starter your-project-name`

This will create a new project folder and install all required dependencies (via composer), currently:

- [greymass/reprint@develop](https://github.com/greymass/reprint/tree/develop)
- [greymass/steemphp](https://github.com/greymass/steemphp)
